DENVER — The Broncos' regular-season finale is set.
Denver will host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, Jan. 4 at 2:25 p.m. MT on CBS, the NFL announced Sunday.
The NFL announced the Week 18 schedule following the conclusion of "Sunday Night Football."
The 2025 AFC West champion Broncos, who will wear their throwback jerseys for the matchup, can clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a win over Los Angeles.
With a victory, the Broncos would secure a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.
Denver has posted a 7-1 mark at home this season.
