DENVER — The Broncos have accomplished their first goal.
Denver is back atop the AFC West, as the Broncos clinched their 16th AFC West division title in franchise history and their first since 2015.
The Broncos officially clinched the division following the Chargers' loss to the Texans on Saturday.
The Broncos' division title is their first since they won the AFC West in five consecutive years from 2011-15, and they will soon host their first playoff game since the 2016 AFC Championship Game that sent Denver to Super Bowl 50.
Denver is the first team in the AFC to win its division this year and the second team in the NFL to accomplish the feat.
Still, more goals are ahead. Broncos Head Coach Sean Payton previously outlined winning the division as the team's first goal. Denver's second objective is to secure the best possible seed for the postseason. The Broncos currently hold the conference's top seed and could clinch the No. 1 spot as early as Sunday.
Denver can also assure itself of home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs and a first-round bye with a win over the Chargers in Week 18.
