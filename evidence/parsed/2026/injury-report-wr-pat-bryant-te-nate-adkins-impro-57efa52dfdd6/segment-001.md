ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Wide receiver Pat Bryant and tight end Nate Adkins improved to full participants Thursday ahead of Denver's Week 18 game against the Chargers.
Bryant (concussion) and Adkins (knee) did not play in Week 17 against the Chiefs, but they returned to practice as limited participants on Wednesday.
Guard Ben Powers (biceps) and inside linebacker Karene Reid (hamstring) remained full participants in practice, while defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers (hip) remained a limited participant.
Linebacker Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) did not practice on Thursday.
The Broncos will announce game statuses on Friday for their regular-season finale.
